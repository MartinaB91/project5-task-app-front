# Family Star
## About
Family Star is a mix between a task board and a game that families can use to make ordinary household tasks to something fun. Parents can add tasks and family members to the family's shared task board. Depending on how challenging or how long time the task takes the parent can adapt how many star points(scores) completion of the task gives. The family member that currently has the highest amount of collected star points is the family star(leader). 

Family members can pick a task to complete by assigning themselves at the task. When the task is completed, the family member marks the task as done.  The tasks progress is followed by two scoreboards, one for the family member and one for the whole family.
In the family member scoreboard, the family member can follow their own progress as it will be updated with information about how many: star points, ongoing tasks and closed tasks the family member has. Instead of only containing information about one family member the family’s scoreboard contains information about the progress of the whole family. It contains information about: who is the family star, how many tasks there is to-do, completed tasks and ongoing tasks.

Currently the site contains these categories: Cleaning, Cooking, Homework and Garden Work.
