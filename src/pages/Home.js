                        Are you tired of trying to get your kids to help out at home?
                        With Family Star you can make ordinary households tasks something fun by turning it into a game!
                        The rules are quite simple, collect as many stars <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faStar} className={styles.FontAwesomeIconStar} /> as you can by completing households
                        tasks from your shared taskboard. The member that has collected the highest amount of star points
                        is the Family Star.
